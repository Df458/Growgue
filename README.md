# Growgue
Growgue is my 7DRL entry for this year.

## Installation
You'll need (probably on your system):
-GNU make
-GCC
-LibXML-2.0

You'll need (probably not on your system, unless you develop things):
-PDCurses
-SDL2
-Lua
`make` should do the trick to compile. If not, send me the output either as an issue or an email (hugues.ross@gmail.com)

## Playing
-Run the `growgue` executable
-Read the controls in-game (All navigation is based on the traditional HJKL scheme)

## Tips
Coming soon
